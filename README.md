Project Overview: How It Works This real-time posture detection system is designed to assist stroke-affected individuals by continuously monitoring their posture using a USB webcam and a Raspberry Pi. The system ensures patient safety by detecting three key positions: sitting, standing, and lying down, and providing real-time notifications to caregivers.

üöÄ How It Works: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Capturing Video ‚Äì A USB webcam records real-time video of the patient. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pose Detection ‚Äì The system uses MediaPipe Pose to detect key body landmarks. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Posture Classification ‚Äì The AI model analyzes the detected landmarks and determines if the person is sitting, standing, or lying down. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Alert System -If the person is sitting, a small notification is triggered. -If the person is standing, an alarm and notification are sent to the caregiver. -If the person is lying down, no alerts are sent. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Response ‚Äì The caregiver receives immediate notifications, enabling them to assist the patient and prevent potential falls.

üéØ Features

‚úÖ Real-time posture detection (Sitting, Standing, Lying Down) ‚úÖ Instant notifications for caregivers when the patient stands up or sits down ‚úÖ Low-cost and efficient solution using a Raspberry Pi and USB webcam ‚úÖ Designed to enhance patient safety and prevent falls üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Hardware: Raspberry Pi, USB Webcam Software: Python, MediaPipe Pose, OpenCV Communication: Real-time alerts for caregivers üîß How to Implement This Project 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup -Raspberry Pi (Recommended: Raspberry Pi 4) -USB Webcam for real-time video capture -Power Supply for the Raspberry Pi -Speakers (for audio alarms, optional) 2Ô∏è‚É£ Software Installation Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi. Then, install the necessary libraries: 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the System Download the project files onto your Raspberry Pi. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run the detection script. The system will start detecting posture and send notifications accordingly. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Customizing Alerts Modify the script to send alerts via email, SMS, or a mobile app based on your caregiver‚Äôs preferences. Integrate with IoT devices (e.g., smart lights or speakers) for enhanced alerts.

This system provides a low-cost, efficient, and real-time solution to enhance patient safety and caregiver response time.
